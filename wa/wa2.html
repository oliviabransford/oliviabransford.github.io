        <p>My goals for this course is to understand basic coding and how it may help me in my design goals after graduating. I am really intimidated by coding and just don't want to feel like I can't do it. </p>
        <p>I am from Atlanta, Georgia. My major is Strategic Communications and minoring in Creative Technology and Design. In life I always want to be creative and never stop coming up with ideas. My favorite hobby I do is crocheting which relaxes me but also allows me to be creative. </p>
