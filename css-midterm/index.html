    <p>Hi! Welcome! My name is Olivia Bransford. I use she/her/hers pronouns. I'm from Atlanta, Georgia and a current junior at the University of Colorado Boulder. I’ve been lucky enough with being surrounded by creative individuals since I was young with my mom in interior design and my dad in the music industry. In high school, my favorite classes were audio video television & film and photography which led me to my interest in design. I appreciated the way I could now expressive myself artistically digitally, cause as a kid I was not good at drawing or painting, which led me to believe I couldn’t be artistically creative and successful at the same time. Now in college I’ve landed on Strategic Communications going down the Media Design track for my major and Creative Technology and Design for my minor. If there’s one thing I want to always do in life, it’s to be the one to come up with the ideas and designs, and be good at it. My favorite application is Illustrator. I hope in the future I can work in the sports or entertainment industries coming up with designs.  </p>
